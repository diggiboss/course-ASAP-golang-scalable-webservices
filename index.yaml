  This is the EXLskills free and open-source A$AP Learn GoLang Course! It's a highly-accelerated open course that's best-suited for people with a bit of background in software engineering to quickly pick up Go, learn the essential best practices, and hit the ground running!
  After this course, you'll be able to build basic Go applications in addition to lightweight webservers, highly-concurrent programs, and reusable libraries in Go that you can share with other developers!
  For further practice, we recommend checking out our Go [Guided Projects](https://exlskills.com/learn-en/projects) that will give you access to a professional Go developer, detailed documentation, and real-world tasks that you can work on to go from the basics of Go, into building production apps.

  This is your course's long-form markdown info text. This will be shown to users in the info tab of your course.

  The '2' above is to tell the YAML parser that everything that's indented by at least two characters below is part of this multi-line text.

  To 'break out' of this info markdown, just add a property without indentation and you'll be dropped back into the primary YAML
