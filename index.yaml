headline: Build & Deploy Your First Go Web Service with Docker A$AP!
description: |2
  This is the EXLskills free and open-source A$AP Scalable Web Services with Go & Docker Course! It's a highly-accelerated open course that's best-suited for people with a bit of background in software engineering to quickly pick up Go, learn the essential best practices, and hit the ground running!
  After this course, you'll be able to build lightweight, scalable, and idiomatic web services that connect to relational (SQL) databases, consider auth, and serve performant JSON REST APIs.
  For further practice, we recommend checking out our Go [Guided Projects](https://exlskills.com/learn-en/projects) that will give you access to a professional Go developer, detailed documentation, and real-world tasks that you can work on to go from the basics of Go, into building production apps.

  This is your course's long-form markdown info text. This will be shown to users in the info tab of your course.

  The '2' above is to tell the YAML parser that everything that's indented by at least two characters below is part of this multi-line text.

  To 'break out' of this info markdown, just add a property without indentation and you'll be dropped back into the primary YAML
